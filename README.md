# Scramble

Our brains are more powerful than censors.  What is the limit to our understanding of language?  This is a silly script that will take a word, phrase, paragraph and scramble the letters of individual words in such a way that many English speakers will still be able to understand the scrambled text.  I'm curious if non-native speakers will also have the same ability?

Note: I used this strategy recently on a website that was blocking certain types of communication between users. I was able to share the needed data and avoid the bot blocker.  This makes me curious if this type of solution might be applicable to other types of communication with auto-censors.
